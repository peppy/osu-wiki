# Client

## Introduction

osu!(lazer) is the next major update to the game. It is the culmination of several years of work behind the scenes to painstakingly reimplement the game.

The eventual goal is that this version will be released as an update which will completely supersede the existing stable version of the game, but there's still some work to be done before that is feasible. At the end of the day, **the players** will dictate when this happens and we will continue to support the previous release until users have migrated across.
